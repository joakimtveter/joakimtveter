# Hi, my name is Joakim Tveter

I work as web developer at [Netpower](https://netpower.no), where I create amazing and accessible user experiences.


I have recently concluded a Higher Professional degree (more or less equivalent to an associate degree) in [Front-end Development](https://www.noroff.no/en/studies/vocational-school/front-end-development) at [Noroff](https://www.noroff.no/en/). Iâ€™m currently learning C# and .NET.
